# App Review Information 

Unified Calendar Sync requires full calendar access to read events from existing calendars and create a unified calendar where events are kept in sync.

To test the app:
1. Ensure at least two calendar accounts are configured in macOS (System Settings → Internet Accounts)
2. Launch the app and grant calendar access
3. Open Settings and select a target account and calendar
4. Enable one or more source calendars and run “Sync Now”
