Privacy Policy

Unified Calendar Sync does not collect, store, or transmit any personal data.

All calendar data remains on the user’s device and is processed locally using Apple’s EventKit framework. No data is sent to external servers, and no analytics or tracking technologies are used.

The app only accesses calendar data that the user explicitly authorizes through macOS system permissions.
